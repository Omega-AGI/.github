# We are continuing the original vision of OpenAI — nonprofit and open source for the benefit of society.

Press release, 17.10.2024

Artificial General Intelligence - where machines achieve universal cognitive abilities to understand, learn, and apply knowledge independently across an unlimited range of tasks - is humanity's greatest opportunity and challenge. Therefore, we believe that AGI should be established as a nonprofit, open source effort to serve all of humanity and democratize access to this transformative technology. OMEGA AGI embodies precisely this commitment.
<br>
<br>
Achieving true AGI requires more than scaling computation; it requires breakthrough advances in research, engineering, and public discourse to ensure security. Intelligence is not simply the accumulation of knowledge, but the ability to learn and adapt. Current models such as LLMs and transformers are significant steps forward, but they are not the ultimate solution. While major players like SSI and OpenAI say goodbye to non-profit and invest enormous financial capital in scaling, we (must) place our bets first and foremost on open and interdisciplinary research and engineering. United as a global community, we can solve this puzzle together if everyone contributes their part. Scaling will be a subsequent challenge, which we are also ready to tackle at the appropriate time.
<br>
<br>
Having both founded and built research-based AI startups and led nonprofits for more than a decade, it's more urgent than ever to put this to work for this mission. We are currently putting together the initial team, consortium and roadmap. If you share this conviction, want to learn and help build AGI, and wish to contribute as a volunteer — be it through research, engineering, development, application, education, PR or behind-the-scenes support — we invite you to contact us. The same goes for research institutions, associations, organizations or companies that want to join, support or collaborate. We are aware that the whole thing will be very challenging, but paths are made by walking them. It is up to all of us to decide how the future will look like.
